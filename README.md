# Consul-Terraform-AWS

## Information

For my internship I created a multicloud setup where I used Tools like Terraform, Consul, Kubernetes & Bash.
In this repo you can see my code for spinning up everything on AWS, including my consul setup and demo application.
I also created a bash script to execute everything from start to finish.
